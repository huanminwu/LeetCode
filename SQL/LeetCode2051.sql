--- Leet code 2051. The Category of Each Member in the Store
---
--- Medium
--- SQL Schema
--- Table: Members
---
--- +-------------+---------+
--- | Column Name | Type    |
--- +-------------+---------+
--- | member_id   | int     |
--- | name        | varchar |
--- +-------------+---------+
--- member_id is the primary key column for this table.
--- Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a member.
--- 
--- Table: Visits
---
--- +-------------+------+
--- | Column Name | Type |
--- +-------------+------+
--- | visit_id    | int  |
--- | member_id   | int  |
--- | visit_date  | date |
--- +-------------+------+
--- visit_id is the primary key column for this table.
--- member_id is a foreign key to member_id from the Members table.
--- Each row of this table contains information about the date of a visit to 
--- the store and the member who visited it.
--- 
--- Table: Purchases
--- +----------------+------+
--- | Column Name    | Type |
--- +----------------+------+
--- | visit_id       | int  |
--- | charged_amount | int  |
--- +----------------+------+
--- visit_id is the primary key column for this table.
--- visit_id is a foreign key to visit_id from the Visits table.
--- Each row of this table contains information about the amount charged in a 
--- visit to the store.
---  
--- A store wants to categorize its members. There are three tiers:
--- "Diamond": if the conversion rate is greater than or equal to 80.
--- "Gold": if the conversion rate is greater than or equal to 50 and less 
--- than 80.
--- "Silver": if the conversion rate is less than 50.
--- "Bronze": if the member never visited the store.
--- The conversion rate of a member is (100 * total number of purchases for 
--- the member) / total number of visits for the member.
---
--- Write an SQL query to report the id, the name, and the category of each 
--- member.
---
--- Return the result table in any order.
---
--- The query result format is in the following example.
--- 
--- Example 1:
--- Input: 
--- Members table:
--- +-----------+---------+
--- | member_id | name    |
--- +-----------+---------+
--- | 9         | Alice   |
--- | 11        | Bob     |
--- | 3         | Winston |
--- | 8         | Hercy   |
--- | 1         | Narihan |
--- +-----------+---------+
--- Visits table:
--- +----------+-----------+------------+
--- | visit_id | member_id | visit_date |
--- +----------+-----------+------------+
--- | 22       | 11        | 2021-10-28 |
--- | 16       | 11        | 2021-01-12 |
--- | 18       | 9         | 2021-12-10 |
--- | 19       | 3         | 2021-10-19 |
--- | 12       | 11        | 2021-03-01 |
--- | 17       | 8         | 2021-05-07 |
--- | 21       | 9         | 2021-05-12 |
--- +----------+-----------+------------+
--- Purchases table:
--- +----------+----------------+
--- | visit_id | charged_amount |
--- +----------+----------------+
--- | 12       | 2000           |
--- | 18       | 9000           |
--- | 17       | 7000           |
--- +----------+----------------+
--- Output: 
--- +-----------+---------+----------+
--- | member_id | name    | category |
--- +-----------+---------+----------+
--- | 1         | Narihan | Bronze   |
--- | 3         | Winston | Silver   |
--- | 8         | Hercy   | Diamond  |
--- | 9         | Alice   | Gold     |
--- | 11        | Bob     | Silver   |
--- +-----------+---------+----------+
--- Explanation: 
--- User Narihan with id = 1 did not make any visits to the store. She gets 
--- a Bronze category.
--- User Winston with id = 3 visited the store one time and did not purchase 
--- anything. The conversion rate = (100 * 0) / 1 = 0. He gets a Silver 
--- category.
--- User Hercy with id = 8 visited the store one time and purchased one time. 
--- The conversion rate = (100 * 1) / 1 = 1. He gets a Diamond category.
--- User Alice with id = 9 visited the store two times and purchased one time. 
--- The conversion rate = (100 * 1) / 2 = 50. She gets a Gold category.
--- User Bob with id = 11 visited the store three times and purchased one 
--- time. The conversion rate = (100 * 1) / 3 = 33.33. He gets a Silver 
--- category.
