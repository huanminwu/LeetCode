--- Leet code 2175. The Change in Global Rankings
---
--- Medium
---
--- SQL Schema
--- Table: TeamPoints
---
--- +-------------+---------+
--- | Column Name | Type    |
--- +-------------+---------+
--- | team_id     | int     |
--- | name        | varchar |
--- | points      | int     |
--- +-------------+---------+
--- team_id is the primary key for this table.
--- Each row of this table contains the ID of a national team, the name of 
--- the country it represents, and the points it has in the global rankings. 
--- No two teams will represent the same country.
---
---
--- Table: PointsChange
--- 
--- +---------------+------+
--- | Column Name   | Type |
--- +---------------+------+
--- | team_id       | int  |
--- | points_change | int  |
--- +---------------+------+
--- team_id is the primary key for this table.
--- Each row of this table contains the ID of a national team and the change 
--- in its points in the global rankings.
--- points_change can be:
--- 0: indicates no change in points.
--- positive: indicates an increase in points.
--- negative: indicates a decrease in points.
--- Each team_id that appears in TeamPoints will also appear in this table.
---
--- The global ranking of a national team is its rank after sorting all the 
--- teams by their points in descending order. If two teams have the same 
--- points, we break the tie by sorting them by their name in lexicographical 
--- order.
---
--- The points of each national team should be updated based on its 
--- corresponding points_change value.
--- Write an SQL query to calculate the change in the global rankings after 
--- updating each team's points.
---
--- Return the result table in any order.
---
--- The query result format is in the following example.
---
--- Example 1:
---
--- Input: 
--- TeamPoints table:
--- +---------+-------------+--------+
--- | team_id | name        | points |
--- +---------+-------------+--------+
--- | 3       | Algeria     | 1431   |
--- | 1       | Senegal     | 2132   |
--- | 2       | New Zealand | 1402   |
--- | 4       | Croatia     | 1817   |
--- +---------+-------------+--------+
--- PointsChange table:
--- +---------+---------------+
--- | team_id | points_change |
--- +---------+---------------+
--- | 3       | 399           |
--- | 2       | 0             |
--- | 4       | 13            |
--- | 1       | -22           |
--- +---------+---------------+
--- Output: 
--- +---------+-------------+-----------+
--- | team_id | name        | rank_diff |
--- +---------+-------------+-----------+
--- | 1       | Senegal     | 0         |
--- | 4       | Croatia     | -1        |
--- | 3       | Algeria     | 1         |
--- | 2       | New Zealand | 0         |
--- +---------+-------------+-----------+
--- Explanation: 
--- The global rankings were as follows:
--- +---------+-------------+--------+------+
--- | team_id | name        | points | rank |
--- +---------+-------------+--------+------+
--- | 1       | Senegal     | 2132   | 1    |
--- | 4       | Croatia     | 1817   | 2    |
--- | 3       | Algeria     | 1431   | 3    |
--- | 2       | New Zealand | 1402   | 4    |
--- +---------+-------------+--------+------+
--- After updating the points of each team, the rankings became the following:
--- +---------+-------------+--------+------+
--- | team_id | name        | points | rank |
--- +---------+-------------+--------+------+
--- | 1       | Senegal     | 2110   | 1    |
--- | 3       | Algeria     | 1830   | 2    |
--- | 4       | Croatia     | 1830   | 3    |
--- | 2       | New Zealand | 1402   | 4    |
--- +---------+-------------+--------+------+
--- Since after updating the points Algeria and Croatia have the same points, 
--- they are ranked according to their lexicographic order.
--- Senegal lost 22 points but their rank did not change.
--- Croatia gained 13 points but their rank decreased by one.
--- Algeria gained 399 points and their rank increased by one.
--- New Zealand did not gain or lose points and their rank did not change.
