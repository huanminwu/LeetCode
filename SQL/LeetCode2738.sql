--- LeetCode 2738. Count Occurrences in Text
--- 
--- Medium
---
--- SQL Schema
--- Table: Files
--- 
--- +-------------+---------+
--- | Column Name | Type    |
--- +-- ----------+---------+
--- | file_name   | varchar |
--- | content     | text    |
--- +-------------+---------+
--- file_name is the primary key of this table. 
--- Each row contains file_name and the content of that file.
--- Write an SQL query to find the number of occurrences of the words 'bull' 
--- and 'bear' as a standalone word, disregarding any instances where it 
--- appears as part of another word (e.g. 'bullet' and 'bears' will not be 
--- considered).
---
--- Return the word 'bull' and 'bear' along with the corresponding number of 
--- occurrences in any order.
---
--- The query result format is in the following example.
--- 
--- Example 1:
--- 
--- Input: 
--- Files table:
--- +------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
--- | file_name  | contenet                                                                         | 
--- +------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
--- | draft1.txt | The stock exchange predicts a bull market which would make many investors happy. | 
--- | draft2.txt | The stock exchange predicts a bull market which would make many investors happy, |
--- |            | but analysts warn of possibility of too much optimism and that in fact we are    |
--- |            | awaiting a bear market.                                                          | 
--- | draft3.txt | The stock exchange predicts a bull market which would make many investors happy, |
--- |            | but analysts warn of possibility of too much optimism and that in fact we are    |
--- |            | awaiting a bear market. As always predicting the future market is an uncertain   |
--- |            | game and all investors should follow their instincts and best practices.         | 
--- +------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
--- Output: 
--- +------+-------+
--- | word | count |  
--- +------+-------+
--- | bull | 3     | 
--- | bear | 2     | 
--- +------+-------+
--- Explanation: 
--- - The word "bull" appears 1 time in "draft1.txt", 1 time in "draft2.txt", 
---   and 1 time in "draft3.txt". Therefore, the total number of occurrences 
---   for the word "bull" is 3.
--- - The word "bear" appears 1 time in "draft2.txt", and 1 time in 
--- "draft3.txt". Therefore, the total number of occurrences for the word 
--- "bear" is 2.
