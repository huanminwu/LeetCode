--- SQL Schema
--- Table: Signups
---
--- +----------------+----------+
--- | Column Name    | Type     |
--- +----------------+----------+
--- | user_id        | int      |
--- | time_stamp     | datetime |
--- +----------------+----------+
--- user_id is the primary key for this table.
--- Each row contains information about the signup time for the user with ID 
--- user_id.
---
--- Table: Confirmations
---
--- +----------------+----------+
--- | Column Name    | Type     |
--- +----------------+----------+
--- | user_id        | int      |
--- | time_stamp     | datetime |
--- | action         | ENUM     |
--- +----------------+----------+
--- (user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key for this table.
--- user_id is a foreign key with a reference to the Signups table.
--- action is an ENUM of the type ('confirmed', 'timeout')
--- Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a 
--- confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either
--- confirmed ('confirmed') or expired without confirming ('timeout').
---
--- The confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages 
--- divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages. The 
--- confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages 
--- is 0. Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places.
---
--- Write an SQL query to find the confirmation rate of each user.
---
--- Return the result table in any order.
---
--- The query result format is in the following example:
