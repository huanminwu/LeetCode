--- Table: Drivers
---
---
--- +--------------+---------+
--- | Column Name  | Type    |
--- +--------------+---------+
--- | driver_id    | int     |
--- | name         | varchar |
--- | age          | int     |
--- | experience   | int     |
--- | accidents    | int     |
--- +--------------+---------+
--- (driver_id) is the unique key for this table.
--- Each row includes a driver's ID, their name, age, years of driving 
--- experience, and the number of accidents theyâ€™ve had.
--- Table: Vehicles
---
--- +--------------+---------+
--- | vehicle_id   | int     |
--- | driver_id    | int     |
--- | model        | varchar |
--- | fuel_type    | varchar |
--- | mileage      | int     |
--- +--------------+---------+
--- (vehicle_id, driver_id, fuel_type) is the unique key for this table.
--- Each row includes the vehicle's ID, the driver who operates it, the model, 
--- fuel type, and mileage.
--- Table: Trips
---
--- +--------------+---------+
--- | trip_id      | int     |
--- | vehicle_id   | int     |
--- | distance     | int     |
--- | duration     | int     |
--- | rating       | int     |
--- +--------------+---------+
--- (trip_id) is the unique key for this table.
--- Each row includes a trip's ID, the vehicle used, the distance covered 
--- (in miles), the trip duration (in minutes), and the passenger's 
--- rating (1-5).
--- Uber is analyzing drivers based on their trips. Write a solution to find 
--- the top-performing driver for each fuel type based on the following 
--- criteria:
---
--- A driver's performance is calculated as the average rating across all 
--- their trips. Average rating should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
--- If two drivers have the same average rating, the driver with the 
--- longer total distance traveled should be ranked higher.
--- If there is still a tie, choose the driver with the fewest accidents.
--- Return the result table ordered by fuel_type in ascending order.
---
--- The result format is in the following example.
---
--- 
--- Example:
--- Input:
--- Drivers table:
--- +-----------+----------+-----+------------+-----------+
--- | driver_id | name     | age | experience | accidents |
--- +-----------+----------+-----+------------+-----------+
--- | 1         | Alice    | 34  | 10         | 1         |
--- | 2         | Bob      | 45  | 20         | 3         |
--- | 3         | Charlie  | 28  | 5          | 0         |
--- +-----------+----------+-----+------------+-----------+
--- Vehicles table:
---
--- +------------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------+
--- | vehicle_id | driver_id | model   | fuel_type | mileage |
--- +------------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------+
--- | 100        | 1         | Sedan   | Gasoline  | 20000   |
--- | 101        | 2         | SUV     | Electric  | 30000   |
--- | 102        | 3         | Coupe   | Gasoline  | 15000   |
--- +------------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------+
--- Trips table:
---
--- +---------+------------+----------+----------+--------+
--- | trip_id | vehicle_id | distance | duration | rating |
--- +---------+------------+----------+----------+--------+
--- | 201     | 100        | 50       | 30       | 5      |
--- | 202     | 100        | 30       | 20       | 4      |
--- | 203     | 101        | 100      | 60       | 4      |
--- | 204     | 101        | 80       | 50       | 5      |
--- | 205     | 102        | 40       | 30       | 5      |
--- | 206     | 102        | 60       | 40       | 5      |
--- +---------+------------+----------+----------+--------+
--- Output:
---
--- +-----------+-----------+--------+----------+
--- | fuel_type | driver_id | rating | distance |
--- +-----------+-----------+--------+----------+
--- | Electric  | 2         | 4.50   | 180      |
--- | Gasoline  | 3         | 5.00   | 100      |
--- +-----------+-----------+--------+----------+
--- Explanation:
---
--- For fuel type Gasoline, both Alice (Driver 1) and Charlie (Driver 3) 
--- have trips. Charlie has an average rating of 5.0, while Alice has 4.5. 
--- Therefore, Charlie is selected.
--- For fuel type Electric, Bob (Driver 2) is the only driver with an average 
--- rating of 4.5, so he is selected.
--- The output table is ordered by fuel_type in ascending order.
