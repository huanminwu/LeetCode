---  chest_id is the primary key for this table.
---  This table contains information about the chests we have, and the 
---  corresponding number if oranges and apples they contain.
---  Write an SQL query to count the number of apples and oranges in all

---
---  Return the result table in any order.
---  The query result format is in the following example:
