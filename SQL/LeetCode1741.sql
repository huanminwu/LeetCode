---  Leet code #1741. Find Total Time Spent by Each Employee
--- 
---  Easy
--- 
---  SQL Schema
---  Table: Employees
---
---  +-------------+------+
---  | Column Name | Type |
---  +-------------+------+
---  | emp_id      | int  |
---  | event_day   | date |
---  | in_time     | int  |
---  | out_time    | int  |
---  +-------------+------+
---  (emp_id, event_day, in_time) is the primary key of this table.
---  The table shows the employees' entries and exits in an office.
---  event_day is the day at which this event happened, in_time is the minute 
---  at which the employee entered the office, and out_time is the minute at 
---  which they left the office.
---  in_time and out_time are between 1 and 1440.
---  It is guaranteed that no two events on the same day intersect in time, 
---  and in_time < out_time.
--- 
---  Write an SQL query to calculate the total time in minutes spent by each 
---  employee on each day at the office. Note that within one day, an employee 
---  can enter and leave more than once. The time spent in the office for a 
---  single entry is out_time - in_time.
--- 
---  Return the result table in any order.
---  
---  The query result format is in the following example:
---  Employees table:
---  +--------+------------+---------+----------+
---  | emp_id | event_day  | in_time | out_time |
---  +--------+------------+---------+----------+
---  | 1      | 2020-11-28 | 4       | 32       |
---  | 1      | 2020-11-28 | 55      | 200      |
---  | 1      | 2020-12-03 | 1       | 42       |
---  | 2      | 2020-11-28 | 3       | 33       |
---  | 2      | 2020-12-09 | 47      | 74       |
---  +--------+------------+---------+----------+
---  Result table:
---  +------------+--------+------------+
---  | day        | emp_id | total_time |
---  +------------+--------+------------+
---  | 2020-11-28 | 1      | 173        |
---  | 2020-11-28 | 2      | 30         |
---  | 2020-12-03 | 1      | 41         |
---  | 2020-12-09 | 2      | 27         |
---  +------------+--------+------------+
---  Employee 1 has three events: two on day 2020-11-28 with a total of 
---  (32 - 4) + (200 - 55) = 173, and one on day 2020-12-03 with a total 
---  of (42 - 1) = 41.
---  Employee 2 has two events: one on day 2020-11-28 with a total of 
---  (33 - 3) = 30, and one on day 2020-12-09 with a total of (74 - 47) = 27.
