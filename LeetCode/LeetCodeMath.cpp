/// Normally, the factorial of a positive integer n is the product of all 
/// positive integers less than or equal to n.  For example, factorial(10) 
/// = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.
///
/// We instead make a clumsy factorial: using the integers in decreasing 
/// order, we swap out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of 
/// operations: multiply (*), divide (/), add (+) and subtract (-) in this 
/// order.
///
/// For example, clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 
/// 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1.  However, these operations are still applied 
/// using the usual order of operations of arithmetic: we do all 
/// multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction 
/// steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to 
/// right.
///
/// Additionally, the division that we use is floor division such that 
/// 10 * 9 / 8 equals 11.  This guarantees the result is an integer.
///
/// Implement the clumsy function as defined above: given an integer N, 
/// it returns the clumsy factorial of N.

/// 
/// Hard
///
/// You are given an array nums of n positive integers and an integer k.
///
/// Initially, you start with a score of 1. You have to maximize your 
/// score by applying the following operation at most k times:
///
/// Choose any non-empty subarray nums[l, ..., r] that you haven't chosen 
/// previously.
/// Choose an element x of nums[l, ..., r] with the highest prime score. 
/// If multiple such elements exist, choose the one with the smallest 
/// index.
/// Multiply your score by x.
/// Here, nums[l, ..., r] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index l 
/// and ending at the index r, both ends being inclusive.
///
/// The prime score of an integer x is equal to the number of distinct 
/// prime factors of x. For example, the prime score of 300 is 3 since 
/// 300 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 5.
/// 
/// Return the maximum possible score after applying at most k operations.
///
/// Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
///
/// Example 1:
/// Input: nums = [8,3,9,3,8], k = 2
/// Output: 81
/// Explanation: To get a score of 81, we can apply the following 
/// operations:
/// - Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 2]. nums[2] is the only element in 
///   this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score 
///   becomes 1 * 9 = 9.
/// - Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have 
///   a prime score of 1, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we 
//    multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 9 * 9 = 81.
/// It can be proven that 81 is the highest score one can obtain.
///
/// Example 2:
/// Input: nums = [19,12,14,6,10,18], k = 3
/// Output: 4788
/// Explanation: To get a score of 4788, we can apply the following 
/// operations: 
/// - Choose subarray nums[0, ..., 0]. nums[0] is the only element in this 
///   subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[0]. The score 
///   becomes 1 * 19 = 19.
/// - Choose subarray nums[5, ..., 5]. nums[5] is the only element in this 
///   subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[5]. The score 
///   becomes 19 * 18 = 342.
/// - Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a
