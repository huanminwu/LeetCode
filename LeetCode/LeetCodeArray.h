/// Leet code #284. Peeking Iterator             
/// Given an Iterator class interface with methods: next() and hasNext(), design and implement 
/// a PeekingIterator that support the peek() operation -- it essentially peek() at the element that 
/// will be returned by the next call to next().
///
/// Here is an example. Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list: [1, 2, 3].
/// Call next() gets you 1, the first element in the list.
/// Now you call peek() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling next() after that still return 2.
///
/// You call next() the final time and it returns 3, the last element. 
/// Calling hasNext() after that should return false. 
/// Hint:
/// 1.Think of "looking ahead". You want to cache the next element.
/// 2.Is one variable sufficient? Why or why not?
/// 3.Test your design with call order of peek() before next() vs next() before peek().
/// 4.For a clean implementation, check out Google's guava library source code.
/// Follow up: How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, not just integer?
