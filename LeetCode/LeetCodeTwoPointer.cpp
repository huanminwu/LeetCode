/// Leet code #881. Boats to Save People
/// 
/// The i-th person has weight people[i], and each boat can carry a maximum 
/// weight of limit.
///
/// Each boat carries at most 2 people at the same time, provided the sum of 
/// the weight of those people is at most limit.
///
/// Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.  (It is 
/// guaranteed each person can be carried by a boat.)
///
/// Example 1:
///
/// Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
/// Output: 1
/// Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
///
/// Example 2:
///
/// Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
/// Output: 3
/// Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
///
/// Example 3:
/// 
/// Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
/// Output: 4
/// Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
/// Note:
/// 
/// 1. 1 <= people.length <= 50000
/// 2. 1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 30000
