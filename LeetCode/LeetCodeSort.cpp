/// Leet code #1606. Find Servers That Handled Most Number of Requests 
/// 
/// Hard
///
/// You have k servers numbered from 0 to k-1 that are being used to 
/// handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite 
/// computational capacity but cannot handle more than one request at 
/// a time. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific 
/// algorithm:
///
/// The ith (0-indexed) request arrives.
/// If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).
/// If the (i % k)th server is available, assign the request to that 
/// server.
/// Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping 
/// around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For 
/// example, if the ith server is busy, try to assign the request to the 
/// (i+1)th server, then the (i+2)th server, and so on.
/// You are given a strictly increasing array arrival of positive 
/// integers, where arrival[i] represents the arrival time of the ith 
/// request, and another array load, where load[i] represents the load 
/// of the ith request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to 
/// find the busiest server(s). A server is considered busiest if it 
/// handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.
///
/// Return a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the busiest server(s). 
/// You may return the IDs in any order.
///
/// Example 1:
/// Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3] 
/// Output: [1] 
/// Explanation:
/// All of the servers start out available.
/// The first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.
/// Request 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next 
/// available server, which is 1.
/// Request 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, 
/// so it is dropped.
/// Servers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two

/// Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4], load = [1,2,1,2]
/// Output: [0]
/// Explanation:
/// The first 3 requests are handled by first 3 servers.
/// Request 3 comes in. It is handled by server 0 since the server is 
/// available.
/// Server 0 handled two requests, while servers 1 and 2 handled one

/// placed of type orderTypei at the price pricei. The orderTypei is:
///
/// 0 if it is a batch of buy orders, or

/// Note that orders[i] represents a batch of amounti independent orders

///
/// There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed.

///
/// If the order is a buy order, you look at the sell order with the

/// Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:

/// The pseudocode of the function is as follows:

/// Initially, all elements are inactive. You may activate them in any order.
///
/// To activate an inactive element at index i, the number of currently active 
/// elements must be strictly less than limit[i].
/// When you activate the element at index i, it adds value[i] to the total 
/// activation value (i.e., the sum of value[i] for all elements that have

/// After each activation, if the number of currently active elements 
/// becomes x, then all elements j with limit[j] <= x become permanently 
/// inactive, even if they are already active.
/// Return the maximum total you can obtain by choosing the activation order 
/// optimally.
/// 
/// Example 1:
/// Input: value = [3,5,8], limit = [2,1,3]
