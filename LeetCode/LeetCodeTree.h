/// 
/// Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or 
/// object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file 
/// or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link 
/// to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
/// 
/// Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize an N-ary tree. An 
/// N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N 
/// children. There is no restriction on how your serialization /
/// deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that 
/// an N-ary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be 
/// deserialized to the original tree structure.
///
/// For example, you may serialize the following 3-ary tree
/// as [1 [3[5 6] 2 4]]. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, 
/// so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
///
/// Note:
/// 1. N is in the range of [1, 1000]
/// 2. Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. 
///    Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
